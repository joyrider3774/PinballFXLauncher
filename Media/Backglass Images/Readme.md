## Backglass Images
These backglass images were initially taken from this dropbox link:
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/l4so158sh8s2ewx/AACO7ZCV5LAOw2I_fORzspZ5a/Cabinet?dl=0&subfolder_nav_tracking=1

Certain backglasses are intially made by "TheTrainGoes" see his github here https://github.com/TheTrainGoes/Pinball-FX3-Backglass

Certain backglasses are from Zen Studios, from promotional images.

But i only had the link so i don't know all who created these initially. There also seemed to be multiple backglass pictures comming from
pinball FX2 and / or Pinball FX3. For those images, i tried to either remove those logos or replace it with a pinball FX Logo

On certain other backglasses i added a logo as i prefer to see the table names in the backglasses.

If you want to use these backglasses also inside the game make a copy of this folder and run rename.bat it will rename the filenames
of the backglasses to the filenames the pinball FX game uses. You just have to copy them to the correct folder of the game then
